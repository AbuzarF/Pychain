# Pychain

## The task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow users to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
## The `PyChain` ledger that was built includes the functionality to create blocks, perform the proof of work consensus protocol, and validate blocks in the chain.
## Coded the additional input areas for the user interface of the Streamlit application. Created these input areas to capture the sender, receiver, and amount for each transaction that will store in the `Block` record.
## Attached the screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should detail a blockchain that consists of multiple blocks.
